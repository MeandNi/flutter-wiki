**Status:** draft

**Objective:** Developers contributing to Flutter can easily and quickly choose impactful issues.

**Strategy:**

* Ensure each issue is actionable.
* Ensure each issue is prioritized. 
* Close issues with the assumption we can always reopen.

When reviewing an issue, ask yourself the following questions:

* Is this issue still valid?
* Is it a dupe?
* Is it high or low priority? (affecting partners/goals)
* Do we have enough info to take action?
* Do we know how to tell if it's done?
  * Sometimes, issues might be valid, but are very very high level (e.g. "It's slow"). We prefer issues that we can test if we've fixed the problem.
* Do we need more info?
* Do we envision taking action on it in the next 6 months?

Then, make the following changes to the issue:

* Engage with the customer/user, empathize with them, get more info to make the issue actionable.
* Close an issue if we don't intend to work on the issue ever.
* If we need more info, add "waiting for customer response" label.
  * If we haven't heard back in two weeks, close the issue.
* Put the issue into the correct milestone, indicating its priority.
