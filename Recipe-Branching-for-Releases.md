## Context

Production builds of both the Flutter Framework and the Engine repositories are created on LUCI. The recipes (actual build scripts) live at [flutter.googlesource.com/recipes](https://flutter.googlesource.com/recipes), while the builder config is maintained in https://github.com/flutter/infra. At this time, there is no version pinning between either of these repositories and the source trees they build (the Flutter framework & engine). This leads to frequent CI failures when preparing beta and stable releases because of changes in the recipes since the release was originally built on master.
