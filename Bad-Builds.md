This is a list of all the dev branch commits that are considered "bad" and should not be released to a more stable channel:

## v0.1.1 - ??

* Builds containing a Dart SDK version that suffers from [dart-lang/sdk#32172](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/32172) (2.0.0-dev.23 - ??) manifest as [#14696](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14696).

## v0.0.22

* Anecdotally, we've seen people complain more when using v0.0.22 than v0.0.21.
