This is a list of all the dev branch commits that are considered "bad" and should not be released to a more stable channel:

* anecdotally, I've seen people complain more when using v0.0.22 than v0.0.21.
* builds containing https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14696, which came in as a regression from Dart SDK 2.0.0-dev.23
