# Flutter's core values

## Build the best way to develop for mobile.

This tells us what we are creating. It helps narrow our focus.

The best way to develop for mobile is a _productive_ way of developing.

The best way to develop for mobile creates _beautiful_ applications.

The best way to develop for mobile creates _fast_ applications.

The best way to develop for mobile enables developers to create applications _fast_.

The best way to develop for mobile is _extensible_, so that we are not a barrier to developers.


## Focus on the user and all else will follow.

Our user is the developer. Our developer's user is the end user of the application written with Flutter.

Our first priority is to our developer's user, the end user. Our second priority is to our user, the developer.

Caring about the end user means having high quality support for accessibility, top performance, stability, high fidelity and compatibility with the user's platform, supporting low-end devices, and so forth.

Caring about the developer means creating a joyful and productive development experience with quick iteration cycles, creating usable, simple, reliable, predictable APIs, giving the developer full access to the underlying platform, and so forth.

We respect our users, whoever they are.
