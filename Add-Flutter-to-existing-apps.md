Making it easy to add Flutter to an existing app is work in progress,
tracked by [#14821](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14821). This page
documents the current state of that work and will be updated as we build out the
necessary tooling.

Last updated August 16, 2018.

The "add2app" support is **in preview**, and is so far only available in the
master channel.

## The Flutter module project template

Flutter projects created using `flutter create xxx` include very simple host
apps for your Flutter/Dart code (a single-Activity Android host and a
single-ViewController iOS host). You can modify these host apps to suit your
needs and build from there.

But if you're starting off with an *existing* host app for either platform,
you'll likely want to include your Flutter project in that app as some form of
library instead.

This is what the Flutter module template provides. Executing
`flutter create -t module xxx` produces a Flutter project containing an Android
library and a Cocoapods pod designed for consumption by your existing host app.

## Android

### Create a Flutter module
Let's assume you have an existing Android app at `some/path/MyApp`, and that you
want your Flutter project as a sibling:
```
$ cd some/path/
$ flutter create -t module my_flutter
```
This creates a `some/path/my_flutter/` Flutter module project with some Dart
code to get you started and a `.android/` hidden subfolder that wraps up the
module project in an Android library.

(While not required in what follows, if you so desire, you can build that library
using Gradle:
```
$ cd .android/
$ ./gradlew flutter:assembleDebug
```
This results in a `flutter-debug.aar` archive file in
`.android/Flutter/build/outputs/aar/`.)

### Make the host app depend on the Flutter module
Include the Flutter module as a sub-project in the host app's `settings.gradle`:
```groovy
// MyApp/settings.gradle
include ':app'                                     // assumed existing content
setBinding(new Binding([gradle: this]))                                 // new
evaluate(new File(                                                      // new
  settingsDir.parentFile,                                               // new
  'my_flutter/.android/include_flutter.groovy'                          // new
))                                                                      // new
```
The binding and script evaluation allows the Flutter module to `include` itself
(as `:flutter`) and any Flutter plugins used by the module (as `:package_info`,
`:video_player`, etc) in the evaluation context of your `settings.gradle`.

Introduce an `implementation` dependency on the Flutter module from your app:
```groovy
// MyApp/app/build.gradle
:
dependencies {
  implementation project(':flutter')
  :
}
```

### Use the Flutter module from your Java code
Use the Flutter module's Java API to add Flutter views to your host app. This
can be done by directly using `Flutter.createView`:
```java
// MyApp/app/src/main/java/some/package/MainActivity.java
fab.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
  @Override
  public void onClick(View view) {
    View flutterView = Flutter.createView(
      MainActivity.this,
      getLifecycle(),
      "route1"
    );
    FrameLayout.LayoutParams layout = new FrameLayout.LayoutParams(600, 800);
    layout.leftMargin = 100;
    layout.topMargin = 200;
    addContentView(flutterView, layout);
  }
});
```
It is also possible to create a `FlutterFragment` that takes care of lifecycle
by itself:
```java
// MyApp/app/src/main/java/some/package/SomeActivity.java
fab.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
 @Override
 public void onClick(View view) {
   FragmentTransaction tx = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
   tx.replace(R.id.someContainer, Flutter.createFragment("route1"));
   tx.commit();
 }
});
```
Above we use the string `"route1"` to tell the Dart code which widget to display
in the Flutter view. The `lib/main.dart` file of the Flutter module project
template should `switch` on (or otherwise interpret) the provided route string,
available as `window.defaultRouteName`, to determine which widget to create and
pass to `runApp`. Schematically,
```dart
import 'dart:ui';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(_widgetForRoute(window.defaultRouteName));

Widget _widgetForRoute(String route) {
  switch (route) {
    case 'route1':
      return SomeWidget(...);
    case 'route2':
      return SomeOtherWidget(...);
    default:
      return Center(
        child: Text('Unknown route: $route', textDirection: TextDirection.ltr),
      );
  }
}
```
It is entirely up to you which route strings you want and how to interpret them.

### Building and running your app
You build and run `MyApp` in exactly the same way that you did before you added
the Flutter module dependency, typically using Android Studio. The same goes for
editing, debugging, and profiling your Android code.

### Hot restart/reload and debugging Dart code
Full IDE integration to support working with the Flutter/Dart code of your
hybrid app is work in progress. But the fundamentals are already present via the
Flutter command line tools and the Dart Observatory web user interface.

Connect a device or launch an emulator. Then make Flutter CLI tooling listen
for your app to come up:
```
$ cd some/path/my_flutter
$ flutter attach
Waiting for a connection from Flutter on Nexus 5X
```
Launch `MyApp` in debug mode from Android Studio (or whichever way you usually
do it). Navigate to an area of the app that uses Flutter. Then turn back to the
terminal, and you should see output similar to the following:
```
Done.
Syncing files to device Nexus 5X...                          5.1s

ðŸ”¥  To hot reload changes while running, press "r". To hot restart (and rebuild state), press "R".
An Observatory debugger and profiler on Nexus 5X is available at: http://127.0.0.1:59556/
For a more detailed help message, press "h". To quit, press "q".
```
You can now edit the Dart code in `my_flutter`, and the changes can be hot
reloaded by pressing `r` in the terminal. You can also paste the URL above into
your browser to use the Dart Observatory for setting breakpoints, analyzing
memory retention and other debugging tasks.

# iOS

TBD

## Experiment: Integrate FlutterViewController
*The guide below is based on an early experiment to add Flutter to an existing iOS app. It contains a lot of
manual steps which we are working on making unnecessary.*

With the right setup Flutter can be used as a UIViewController embedded in an existing app.

The following steps integrate a Flutter app `embedded` (with a layout like that of `flutter create`) into an existing iOS app `embedder`.

### Disable bitcode
Currently the flutter aot compiled code is not compatible with bitcode.

Go to the project view of `embedder` and choose the build target. Go to the "build settings" tab. Find "Enable bitcode" and switch to "no".

### Create a Flutter group/folder
The flutter compilation will place artifacts here.

Right-click the `embedder` project and choose "new Group" name the group Flutter.

### Create and use a flutter settings .xcconfig file
The settings file contains information about the location of the flutter installation, the flutter framework (contains the engine) and the flutter app you want to integrate. It also contains the build mode (debug/profile/release).

For a flutter project `flutter build` creates this settings file automatically (`Generated.xcconfig`). For this scenario we have to create and maintain it manually.

Right click the "Flutter" group and choose "new file" choose the "configuration settings file", give it a name (eg. FlutterConfig.xcconfig). Replace the template with something like:
```
#include "./path/to/embedded/ios/Flutter/Generated.xcconfig"
```
An easy way to get the paths right to copy it from `embedded` (after running it with `flutter run`).

Now this configuration file must be included in your existing xcconfig file with the line:
```
#include "Flutter/FlutterConfig.xcconfig"
```

If you have no existing xcconfig file for your target you can create one (for example `Debug.xcconfig`) and point your target to it by going to the project view, choosing the project, take the "info" tab, go to the "Configurations" section, and choose `Debug` for the target.

### Create a `AppFrameworkInfo.plist` file
_This step is no longer needed after https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/18358)._

This file is copied into the `app.framework` that contains the code snapshot.

Right click the "Flutter" folder, "New File" , "Property List", name it `AppFrameworkInfo.plist`. Give it the following contents:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleDevelopmentRegion</key>
        <string>en</string>
        <key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
        <string>App</string>
        <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
        <string>io.flutter.flutter.app</string>
        <key>CFBundleInfoDictionaryVersion</key>
        <string>6.0</string>
        <key>CFBundleName</key>
        <string>App</string>
        <key>CFBundlePackageType</key>
        <string>FMWK</string>
        <key>CFBundleShortVersionString</key>
        <string>1.0</string>
        <key>CFBundleSignature</key>
        <string>????</string>
        <key>CFBundleVersion</key>
        <string>1.0</string>
        <key>UIRequiredDeviceCapabilities</key>
        <array>
            <string>arm64</string>
        </array>
        <key>MinimumOSVersion</key>
        <string>8.0</string>
    </dict>
</plist>
```

### Make a build-step that calls `xcode-backend.sh`
The `xcode-backend.sh` script compiles the flutter app, and copies the right engine to the "Flutter" folder.

In the project view, choose the target, go to the "Build Phases" tab, press "+" in the upper left corner. Choose "New Run Script Phase". Change the script to `/bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" build`. Drag the phase to be after "Target dependencies" or "Check Pods Manifest.lock".

### Add the Flutter artifacts to the project.
First build the target. This will fail, but before failing it will run `xcode-backend.sh`.
Right click the "Flutter" folder. Choose "Add Files to "embedded"". Mark the files/folders `app.framework`, `flutter.framework` and `flutter_assets`.

Now go to the project view, and choose the target. Go to the "General" tab and in the "Embedded Binaries" section, press "+" and choose the "app.framework" and "flutter.framework" frameworks.

### Make your ApplicationDelegate a `FlutterAppLifeCycleProvider`
This will forward app lifecycle events to your plugins and keep the connection to the flutter tools open during pause.

* Create a `FlutterPluginAppLifeCycleDelegate` and forward events to it.
* And then implement `FlutterAppLifeCycleProvider` to get notified when plugins subscribe for events.

Here is the minimal code forwarding all events:

AppDelegate.h:
```
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import <Flutter/Flutter.h>

@interface AppDelegate : FlutterAppDelegate <UIApplicationDelegate, FlutterAppLifeCycleProvider>
@end
```

AppDelegate.m:
```
#import <Flutter/Flutter.h>

@interface AppDelegate ()

@end

@implementation AppDelegate

{
    FlutterPluginAppLifeCycleDelegate *_lifeCycleDelegate;
}
- (instancetype)init {
    if (self = [super init]) {
        _lifeCycleDelegate = [[FlutterPluginAppLifeCycleDelegate alloc] init];
    }
    return self;
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application
didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions {
    return [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];
}

// Returns the key window's rootViewController, if it's a FlutterViewController.
// Otherwise, returns nil.
- (FlutterViewController*)rootFlutterViewController {
    UIViewController* viewController = [UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow.rootViewController;
    if ([viewController isKindOfClass:[FlutterViewController class]]) {
        return (FlutterViewController*)viewController;
    }
    return nil;
}

- (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event {
    [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event];

    // Pass status bar taps to key window Flutter rootViewController.
    if (self.rootFlutterViewController != nil) {
        [self.rootFlutterViewController handleStatusBarTouches:event];
    }
}

- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication*)application {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate applicationDidEnterBackground:application];
}

- (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication*)application {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate applicationWillEnterForeground:application];
}

- (void)applicationWillResignActive:(UIApplication*)application {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate applicationWillResignActive:application];
}

- (void)applicationDidBecomeActive:(UIApplication*)application {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate applicationDidBecomeActive:application];
}

- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication*)application {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate applicationWillTerminate:application];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application
didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings*)notificationSettings {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application
didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application
didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData*)deviceToken {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application
didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application
didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary*)userInfo
fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))completionHandler {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application
       didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo
             fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application
            openURL:(NSURL*)url
            options:(NSDictionary<UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey, id>*)options {
    return [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application openURL:url options:options];
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application handleOpenURL:(NSURL*)url {
    return [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application handleOpenURL:url];
}

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application
            openURL:(NSURL*)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString*)sourceApplication
         annotation:(id)annotation {
    return [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application
                                   openURL:url
                         sourceApplication:sourceApplication
                                annotation:annotation];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application
performActionForShortcutItem:(UIApplicationShortcutItem*)shortcutItem
  completionHandler:(void (^)(BOOL succeeded))completionHandler NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(9_0) {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application
       performActionForShortcutItem:shortcutItem
                  completionHandler:completionHandler];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application
handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:(nonnull NSString*)identifier
  completionHandler:(nonnull void (^)(void))completionHandler {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application
handleEventsForBackgroundURLSession:identifier
                  completionHandler:completionHandler];
}

- (void)application:(UIApplication*)application
performFetchWithCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult result))completionHandler {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate application:application performFetchWithCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
}

- (void)addApplicationLifeCycleDelegate:(NSObject<FlutterPlugin>*)delegate {
    [_lifeCycleDelegate addDelegate:delegate];
}

@end
```

### Use a FlutterViewController in your App
Now you can insert a FlutterViewController somewhere in your code (or in a storyboard).
The following code demonstrates pushing a FlutterViewController to the current NavigationController, and receiving messages from Flutter.

```
#include <Flutter/Flutter.h>

...

- (void)pushFlutter {
    if (!_flutterViewController) {
       _flutterViewController = [[FlutterViewController alloc] initWithProject:nil nibName:nil bundle:nil];
       messageChannel = [FlutterBasicMessageChannel messageChannelWithName:@"channel"
                                                           binaryMessenger:_flutterViewController
                                                                      codec:[FlutterStandardMessageCodec sharedInstance]];
        UINavigationController*  __weak weakSelf = self;
        [messageChannel setMessageHandler:^(id message, FlutterReply reply) {
            // Any message on this channel pops the Flutter view.
            [[weakSelf navigationController] popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
            reply(@"");
        }];
    }
    NSAssert([self navigationController], @"Must have a NaviationController");
    [[self navigationController]  pushViewController:_flutterViewController2 animated:YES];
}
```
The Dart side can use the channel like:
```
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

BasicMessageChannel channel =
    new BasicMessageChannel("channel", new StandardMessageCodec());

void pop() {
  channel.send({});
}
```

If you use several Flutter views  you can use `[_flutterViewController setInitialRoute:@"route/for/view"]` and dispatch from Dart.

Now you should be able to run the project from xCode!

### Running with hot reload enabled.
Compile the project to an app (remember to put it in debug-mode from the xcconfig file to enable hot reload).
From the command-line you should be able to do something like from the folder of `embedder`:

```
/usr/bin/env xcrun xcodebuild build -configuration Debug ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES VERBOSE_SCRIPT_LOGGING=YES -project embedder.xcodeproj -scheme embedder BUILD_DIR=build/ios -sdk iphoneos -arch arm64
```

And then (from inside the folder of `embedded`) run:
```
flutter run --use-application-binary /path/to/embedder/build/ios/Debug-iphoneos/embedder.app
```

### Plugins
TBD.
