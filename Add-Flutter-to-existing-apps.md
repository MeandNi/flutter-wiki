Making it easy to add Flutter to an existing app is work in progress, tracked by [#14821](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14821). This page documents ongoing experiments and will be updated as we find more and better ways to do this, and as we build out tooling to aid.

# Recommendations
*As this is work in progress, recommendations change frequently at the moment. You may want to wait until some of the dust has settled.*

2018-06-22 Preview of new Flutter module template for Android. Follow the [guide below][android-module-preview] to
try it out.

2018-06-20 You may want to wait for the new Flutter module template of [the flutter_module branch](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tree/flutter_module) to land on Flutter master. We're getting closer! Today, [#18633](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/18633) landed on Flutter master, bringing Flutter tooling support for plugins when adding Flutter as a library to an Android app as detailed in the [experimental guide below][android-experiment]. The Flutter module will make the process much easier, and bring support for adding Flutter Views rather than just Activities.

2018-06-11 iOS: Follow the [experimental guide below][ios-experiment].

2018-04-09 Android: Follow the [experimental guide below][android-experiment].

# Android

## Preview: Use the Flutter module template
*Applies to work off the flutter/flutter master branch after [#18697](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/18697) which landed on 2018-06-22. The functionality described below is an early **preview**: Until it has landed on the beta branch, it is subject to change without warning.*

### Create a Flutter module
Let's assume you have an existing Android app at `some/path/MyApp`, and that you want
your Flutter project as a sibling:
```
$ cd some/path/
$ flutter create -t module my_flutter
```
This creates a `some/path/my_flutter/` Flutter module project with some Dart code
to get you started and an `.android/` subfolder that wraps up the module project in
an Android library.

### Make the host app depend on the Flutter module
Include the Flutter module as a sub-project in the host app's `settings.gradle`:
```groovy
// MyApp/settings.gradle
include ':app'                                     // assumed existing content
setBinding(new Binding([gradle: this]))                                 // new
evaluate(new File(                                                      // new
  settingsDir.parentFile,                                               // new
  'my_flutter/.android/include_flutter.groovy'                          // new
))                                                                      // new
```
The binding and script evaluation allows the Flutter module to `include` itself (as `:flutter`)
and any Flutter plugins used by the module (as `:package_info`, `:video_player`, etc) in the
evaluation context of your `settings.gradle`.
 
Introduce an `implementation` dependency on the Flutter module from your app:
```groovy
// MyApp/app/build.gradle
:
dependencies {
  implementation project(':flutter')
  :
}
```

### Use the Flutter module from your Java code

Use the Flutter module's Java API to add Flutter views to your host app. This can be done
by directly using `Flutter.createView`:
```java
// MyApp/app/src/main/java/some/package/MainActivity.java
fab.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
  @Override
  public void onClick(View view) {
    View flutterView = Flutter.createView(
      MainActivity.this,
      getLifecycle(),
      "route1"
    );
    FrameLayout.LayoutParams layout = new FrameLayout.LayoutParams(600, 800);
    layout.leftMargin = 100;
    layout.topMargin = 200;
    addContentView(flutterView, layout);
  }
});
```
It is also possible to create a `FlutterFragment` that takes care of lifecycle by itself:
```java
// MyApp/app/src/main/java/some/package/SomeActivity.java
fab.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
 @Override
 public void onClick(View view) {
   FragmentTransaction tx = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
   tx.replace(R.id.someContainer, Flutter.createFragment("route1"));
   tx.commit();
 }
});
```
Above we use the string `"route1"` to tell the Dart code which widget to display in the
Flutter view. The `lib/main.dart` file of the Flutter module project template contains a
`switch` on the provided route string. It is up to you which route strings you want and
how to interpret them.

## Experiment: Turn the Flutter Project into a Module
*This guide below is based on an early experiment to add a Flutter Activity to an existing Android app. It works with the Flutter master branch from 2018-06-20 and onwards. The guide contains a lot of manual steps which we are working to make unnecessary.*

The following experiment allows to use a Flutter project as an Android activity. The Android and Flutter projects live in separate directories.

This approach works best if the communication between the existing Android application and the Flutter activity is limited. Also, the combined application does not support hot-reload (with the given instructions) and it's therefore more convenient if the Flutter activity can be developed as a separate application first.

Fundamentally, a Flutter application is turned into an Android activity. The existing Android project declares a dependency on the Flutter activity which is then automatically built and pulled in during the build process of the Android application.

### In the Flutter Tools Project
The gradle library for Flutter assumed that it dealt with an Application extension. This has been fixed on Master (with [731ed1b](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/731ed1b11b388f714eaeb3ed03969f27d195e1a2)). Since this version hasn't been released yet, users might need to apply the following patch to their Flutter tools:

### On the Flutter Side
As a simplification, we don't implement any communication between the container app and the Flutter activity. It would be trivial to support intent-based messages, but other forms of communications are probably simple as well.

We start by creating a fresh Flutter project:
```
·êÖ flutter create flutter_part
```

Changing an application to become an activity library is done in the `build.gradle` file:
``` diff

         targetSdkVersion 27
         versionCode 1
```

At this point we can also remove the `android:name`, `android:label` and `android:icon` from the `<application>` tag in Flutters `AndroidManifest.xml`. This is not required, because the Android app can force an overwrite of these attributes, but it requires more work on the other side.

Also, we remove the `intent-filter` entry, since we don't expect the Flutter activity to be launched directly.

```
Since the `FlutterApplication` was responsible for initializing the system, we now need to add an initialization call to the `onCreate` method of the Activity (`android/app/src/main/java/com/example/flutterpart/MainActivity.java`):

``` Java
public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {
  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    io.flutter.view.FlutterMain.startInitialization(this.getApplicationContext());  // <= New.
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    GeneratedPluginRegistrant.registerWith(this);
  }
}
```

### On the Android Side
This section explains how the existing Android application can use the Flutter activity.

For simplicity we assume a fresh Android application (with a button) that has been created using Android Studio.
The minimal requirement for the Android application must be set to the same (or higher) minimal requirement as Flutter (minSdkVersion: 16).

The Flutter project and any plugins must be included in the `settings.gradle` file:
```
include ':app', ':flutter_part'
def flutterProjectRoot = new File(settingsDir, '../flutter_part')
project(':flutter_part').projectDir = new File(flutterProjectRoot, 'android/app')

def plugins = new Properties()
def pluginsFile = new File(flutterProjectRoot, '.flutter-plugins')
if (pluginsFile.exists()) {
    pluginsFile.withReader('UTF-8') { reader -> plugins.load(reader) }
}

plugins.each { name, path ->
    def pluginDirectory = flutterProjectRoot.toPath().resolve(path).resolve('android').toFile()
    include ":$name"
    project(":$name").projectDir = pluginDirectory
}
```
(This assumes that the Flutter project lives in a directory adjacent to the Android application.)

At this point the project won't compile anymore because the Flutter module needs to know where the Flutter project is located. We fix this by updating the `local.properties` file:

```
flutter.sdk=/your/path/to/flutter
```
This line can be copied from the Flutter projects's `android/local.properties` file.

Now, we need to change the application's gradle file so that it depends on the library:

``` diff
diff --git a/app/build.gradle b/app/build.gradle
index 000886d..82dd2f3 100644
--- a/app/build.gradle
+++ b/app/build.gradle

     androidTestImplementation 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.0.1'
+    implementation project(":flutter_part")
 }
```

After that the Flutter activity can be launched like any other Android activity:
``` Java
    private void startFlutterActivity(View view) {
        ComponentName componentName = new ComponentName(this, "com.example.flutterpart.MainActivity");
        Intent intent = new Intent().setComponent(componentName);
        startActivity(intent);
    }
```

### Hot Reload / Restart
Flutter can hot reload and restart code inside an existing Android application. Invoking `flutter run` with the `--use-application-binary` flag launches the Android application and connects to the Flutter VM once it is available.

Make sure that the application is rebuilt. (The easiest is usually to run `./gradlew assembleDebug`).

In the flutter-part directory, run Flutter with the existing Android application as follows:

```
flutter run --use-application-binary ../MyApplication/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

This assumes that the existing Android application is named `MyApplication` and is located directly next to the Flutter directory. Once the application launches, navigate to the Flutter activity, at which point Flutter will automatically connect to the VM.

Note that the Android application includes a snapshot of the Flutter activity. As long as the application is not recompiled it will start up with that state. However, a restart (pressing "R") will upload the latest code.

### Troubleshooting
Here are common error messages and how they can be fixed.

---

```
Unable to resolve dependency for ':app@debug/compileClasspath': Could not resolve project :flutter_part.
```
This error message happens when the Flutter project is still an application. Make sure to update the `android/app/build.gradle`.

---

```
Library projects cannot set applicationId. applicationId is set to 'com.example.flutterpart' in default config.
```
As explained by the error message: Library projects cannot have `applicationId`s. Just delete that line in `android/app/build.gradle`.

---

```
Manifest merger failed : Attribute application@label value=(@string/app_name) from AndroidManifest.xml:8:9-41
	is also present at [:flutter_part] AndroidManifest.xml:27:9-37 value=(flutter_part).
	Suggestion: add 'tools:replace="android:label"' to <application> element at AndroidManifest.xml:5:5-22:19 to override.
```

This happens when the flutter-part's `AndroidManifest.xml` still contains `android:name`, `android:label` and `android:icon` attributes in the `<application>` tag. Either remove them, or override them (as suggested in the error message).

---

```
Element type "application" must be followed by either attribute specifications, ">" or "/>".
```

This happens when deleting `android:name`, `android:label` and `android:icon` from the `AndroidManifest.xml` file without leaving the closing `>` for the `application` tag. Just add the `>` where you deleted 
these attributes.

---

Two launcher entries are added when the Android application is installed.

This happens when the `AndroidManifest.xml` still contains the `<intent-filter>` entry.

---

When invoking `flutter run` with the Android application's `apk` the application starts in the Flutter app.

This happens when the `AndroidManifest.xml` still contains the `<intent-filter>` entry. In that case `flutter run` immediately launches the Flutter activity.

# iOS

## Experiment: Integrate FlutterViewController
*The guide below is based on an early experiment to add Flutter to an existing iOS app. It contains a lot of
manual steps which we are working on making unnecessary.*

With the right setup Flutter can be used as a UIViewController embedded in an existing app.

The following steps integrate a Flutter app `embedded` (with a layout like that of `flutter create`) into an existing iOS app `embedder`.

### Disable bitcode
Currently the flutter aot compiled code is not compatible with bitcode.

Go to the project view of `embedder` and choose the build target. Go to the "build settings" tab. Find "Enable bitcode" and switch to "no".

### Create a Flutter group/folder
The flutter compilation will place artifacts here.

Right-click the `embedder` project and choose "new Group" name the group Flutter. 

### Create and use a flutter settings .xcconfig file
The settings file contains information about the location of the flutter installation, the flutter framework (contains the engine) and the flutter app you want to integrate. It also contains the build mode (debug/profile/release).

For a flutter project `flutter build` creates this settings file automatically (`Generated.xcconfig`). For this scenario we have to create and maintain it manually. 

Right click the "Flutter" group and choose "new file" choose the "configuration settings file", give it a name (eg. FlutterConfig.xcconfig). Replace the template with something like:
```
#include "./path/to/embedded/ios/Flutter/Generated.xcconfig"
```
An easy way to get the paths right to copy it from `embedded` (after running it with `flutter run`).

Now this configuration file must be included in your existing xcconfig file with the line:
```
#include "Flutter/FlutterConfig.xcconfig"
```

If you have no existing xcconfig file for your target you can create one (for example `Debug.xcconfig`) and point your target to it by going to the project view, choosing the project, take the "info" tab, go to the "Configurations" section, and choose `Debug` for the target.

### Create a `AppFrameworkInfo.plist` file
_This step is no longer needed after https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/18358)._

This file is copied into the `app.framework` that contains the code snapshot.

Right click the "Flutter" folder, "New File" , "Property List", name it `AppFrameworkInfo.plist`. Give it the following contents:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">

        </array>
        <key>MinimumOSVersion</key>
        <string>8.0</string>
    </dict>
</plist>
```

### Make a build-step that calls `xcode-backend.sh`
The `xcode-backend.sh` script compiles the flutter app, and copies the right engine to the "Flutter" folder.

In the project view, choose the target, go to the "Build Phases" tab, press "+" in the upper left corner. Choose "New Run Script Phase". Change the script to `/bin/sh "$FLUTTER_ROOT/packages/flutter_tools/bin/xcode_backend.sh" build`. Drag the phase to be after "Target dependencies" or "Check Pods Manifest.lock".

### Add the Flutter artifacts to the project.
First build the target. This will fail, but before failing it will run `xcode-backend.sh`.
Right click the "Flutter" folder. Choose "Add Files to "embedded"". Mark the files/folders `app.framework`, `flutter.framework` and `flutter_assets`.

Now go to the project view, and choose the target. Go to the "General" tab and in the "Embedded Binaries" section, press "+" and choose the "app.framework" and "flutter.framework" frameworks.

### Make your ApplicationDelegate a `FlutterAppLifeCycleProvider`
This will forward app lifecycle events to your plugins and keep the connection to the flutter tools open during pause. 

* Create a `FlutterPluginAppLifeCycleDelegate` and forward events to it. 
* And then implement `FlutterAppLifeCycleProvider` to get notified when plugins subscribe for events.

Here is the minimal code forwarding all events:

AppDelegate.h:
```
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import <Flutter/Flutter.h>

@interface AppDelegate : FlutterAppDelegate <UIApplicationDelegate, FlutterAppLifeCycleProvider>
@end
```

AppDelegate.m:
```
#import <Flutter/Flutter.h>

@interface AppDelegate ()

@end

### Use a FlutterViewController in your App
Now you can insert a FlutterViewController somewhere in your code (or in a storyboard).
The following code demonstrates pushing a FlutterViewController to the current NavigationController, and receiving messages from Flutter.

```
#include <Flutter/Flutter.h>

...

- (void)pushFlutter {
    if (!_flutterViewController) {
       _flutterViewController = [[FlutterViewController alloc] initWithProject:nil nibName:nil bundle:nil];
       messageChannel = [FlutterBasicMessageChannel messageChannelWithName:@"channel"
                                                           binaryMessenger:_flutterViewController
                                                                      codec:[FlutterStandardMessageCodec sharedInstance]];
        UINavigationController*  __weak weakSelf = self;
        [messageChannel setMessageHandler:^(id message, FlutterReply reply) {
            // Any message on this channel pops the Flutter view.
            [[weakSelf navigationController] popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
            reply(@"");
        }];
    }
    NSAssert([self navigationController], @"Must have a NaviationController");
    [[self navigationController]  pushViewController:_flutterViewController2 animated:YES];
}
```
The Dart side can use the channel like:
```
import 'package:flutter/services.dart';

BasicMessageChannel channel =
    new BasicMessageChannel("channel", new StandardMessageCodec());

void pop() {
  channel.send({});
}
```

If you use several Flutter views  you can use `[_flutterViewController setInitialRoute:@"route/for/view"]` and dispatch from Dart.

Now you should be able to run the project from xCode!

### Running with hot reload enabled.
Compile the project to an app (remember to put it in debug-mode from the xcconfig file to enable hot reload).
From the command-line you should be able to do something like from the folder of `embedder`:

```
/usr/bin/env xcrun xcodebuild build -configuration Debug ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES VERBOSE_SCRIPT_LOGGING=YES -project embedder.xcodeproj -scheme embedder BUILD_DIR=build/ios -sdk iphoneos -arch arm64
```

And then (from inside the folder of `embedded`) run:
```
flutter run --use-application-binary /path/to/embedder/build/ios/Debug-iphoneos/embedder.app
```

### Plugins
TBD.
