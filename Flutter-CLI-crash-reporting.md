If you have not opted-out of Flutter's analytics and crash reporting, when a `flutter` command crashes it attempts to send a crash report to Google in order to help Google contribute improvements to Flutter over time. A crash report may contain the following information:

* The name and version of your local operating system
* The version of Flutter
* The runtime type of the error, e.g. `StateError` or `NoSuchMethodError`
* The error message
* The stack trace generated by the crash, which contains references to Flutter CLI's own code and contains no references to your application code
* A stable client ID - a constant and unique number generated for the computer where Flutter is installed. It helps us deduplicate multiple identical crash reports coming from the same computer. It also helps us verify if a fix works as indended after you upgrade to the next version of Flutter.
