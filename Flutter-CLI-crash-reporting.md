If you have not opted-out of Flutter's analytics and crash reporting, when a `flutter` command crashes it attempts to send a crash report to Google in order to help Google contribute improvements to Flutter over time. A crash report may contain the following information:

* The name and version of your local operating system
* The version of Flutter
* The runtime type of the error, e.g. `StateError` or `NoSuchMethodError`
* The stack trace generated by the crash, which contains references to Flutter CLI's own code and contains no references to your application code
* A stable client ID - a constant and unique number generated for the computer where Flutter is installed. It helps us deduplicate multiple identical crash reports coming from the same computer.
