### Notable issues

* Decoding image data is failing on web: [#74489](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74489)
* [webview_flutter] Simulator keyboard isn’t showing and hardware keyboard isn’t working: [#74044](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74044)
* Enter/return key on a TextField with InkWell doesn’t work on the Samsung keyboard: [#74041](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74041)
* Avoid reading clipboard without authorization when using textfield on Xiaomi MIUI 12: [#74139](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74139)
* Some users are experiencing issues with third-party packages that rely on `flutter_localizations` and `intl` on beta and above channels, they are forced to use `stable` channel to avoid package conflicts. This is caused by premature `flutter_localizations` dependency on the null-safety version of the `intl`. E.g. [#74421](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74421), [#74419](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/74419), [#73861](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/73861)
