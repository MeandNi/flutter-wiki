|Keerti Parthasarathy <keertip@users.noreply.github.com>|Add track-widget-creation flag to attach command ([#31262](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31262))  * Add track-widget-creation flag to attach command  * use the flag|
|Justin McCandless <justinjmccandless@gmail.com>|Text field scroll physics ([#31088](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31088))  TextField and CupertinoTextField can now specify scrollPhysics. Cupertino defaults to bouncing now.|
|MH Johnson <johnsonmh@users.noreply.github.com>|Revert "[Material] Update slider and slider theme with new sizes, shapes, and color mappings ([#30390](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30390))" ([#31339](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31339))  This reverts commit b1039f0f1b761b0e4ec1825eed269b10af6104d4.  (This is a temporary revert while some of our customers deal with the breaking changes involved.)|
|Ben Konyi <bkonyi@google.com>|Fixed flutter_attach_test not respecting authentication codes ([#31321](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31321))|
|Ben Konyi <bkonyi@google.com>|Fixed failing tests caused by introduction of authentication codes ([#31315](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31315))|
|Christopher Fujino <christopherfujino@gmail.com>|Add flutter attach documentation ([#31279](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31279))  * add attach.md document|
|Ben Konyi <bkonyi@google.com>|Updated flutter_driver to support auth codes ([#31310](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31310))|
|Ben Konyi <bkonyi@google.com>|Added support for authentication codes for the VM service. ([#30857](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30857))  * Added support for authentication codes for the VM service.  Previously, a valid web socket connection would use the following URI:  `ws://127.0.0.1/ws`  Now, by default, the VM service requires a connection to be made with a URI similar to the following:  `ws://127.0.0.1:8181/Ug_U0QVsqFs=/ws`  where `Ug_U0QVsqFs` is an authentication code generated and shared by the service.  This behavior can be disabled with the `--disable-service-auth-codes` flag.|
|Devon Carew <devoncarew@google.com>|add daemon.log to the daemon spec ([#31273](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31273))  * add daemon.log to the daemon spec  * mention use in flutter run --machine|
|stuartmorgan <stuart.morgan@gmail.com>|Add desktop workflows to doctor ([#31283](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31283))  The 'doctor' check to determine if any devices can be listed for the device should consider desktop workflows as well.  This has no effect unless the environment variable to enable desktop device listing is set.|
|Jonah Williams <jonahwilliams@google.com>|Add flutter run support for linux and windows ([#31229](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31229))|
|Jonah Williams <jonahwilliams@google.com>|initial work on coverage generating script for tool ([#29494](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/29494))|

|Jonah Williams <jonahwilliams@google.com>|pass track widget creation flag through to build script ([#31277](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/31277))|
|Anthony <anthonyrobledo@gmail.com>|[Material] Update slider and slider theme with new sizes, shapes, and color mappings ([#30390](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30390))  This PR makes a number of changes to the visual appearance of material sliders:  Sizes/Shapes ** enabled thumb radius from 6 to 10 ** disabled thumb radius from 4 to 10 with no gap ** default track shape is a rounded rect rather than a rect ** Colors ** all of the colors now use the new color scheme ** overlay opacity has been reduce from 16% to 12% ** value indicator text color now respects the indicator it is on by using onPrimary ** disabledThumb color no respects the surface it is on by using onSurface The slider theme is also now constructed consistently with other theme objects within the ThemeData. By default, all values are null, and have default values that are resolved in the slider itself, rather than in the slider theme.|

|liyuqian <liyuqian@google.com>|Allow profile widget builds in profile mode ([#30990](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30990))  ## Description  Previously, such function is only available in the debug mode. But the performance information is very noisy in debug mode with JIT. I feel that such function is as important and useful as the performance overlay and the `--trace-skia` option for the GPU thread.  So we should give it the same ability to run in both profile and debug mode.  I've tested it using flutter_gallery in the profile mode. There's no observable difference in the performance overlay between toggling widget build profiling.  ## Related Issues  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30984|

|Todd Volkert <tvolkert@users.noreply.github.com>|Add `const Border.uniform()` ([#30640](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30640))  `Border.all()` is a factory constructor and thus not const constructible. This change adds a `const Border.uniform()` constructor and makes `Border.all()` delegate to it. This allows callers to more likely be able to make their widget tree const constructible.|
|Todd Volkert <tvolkert@users.noreply.github.com>|Add Form.onSaved ([#30643](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30643))  When submitting data to a server, callers need a callback that will get invoked after all the individual form fields are saved. If they have a button that submits the form, they could just do this logic in the click handler for the button (save the form, then submit to the server), but if they have more ways than one to submit the form (i.e. hitting enter while in a text form field), then it becomes more convoluted and calls for a unified callback that will get notified when the form is submitted.|

|Amir Hardon <amirh@users.noreply.github.com>|Make sure _handleAppFrame is only registered once per frame ([#30346](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30346))  There were 2 possible scenarios in which _handleAppFrame is added more than once as a frame callback. When this happens it is possible that the second invocation will try to access _nextFrame.image when _nextFrame is null and crash. The 2 scenarios are:  Scenario 1  A GIF frame is decoded and a Flutter frame is executed before it's time to show the next GIF frame. The timer that's waiting for enough time to elapse is invoked, and schedules a callback for the next Flutter frame(here). Before the next Flutter frame is executed, MultiFrameImageStreamCompleter#removeListener is called followed by ``MultiFrameImageStreamCompleter#addListenerthat is invoking_decodeNextFrameAndSchedule` which is adding `_handleAppFrame` again as a next frame callback. Scenario 2 removeListener and addListener are called multiple times in succession, every call to addListener can result in another registration of _handleAppFrame to the next Flutter frame callbacks list.  This patch fixes the issue by guarding against a second registration of _handleAppFrame.|

The properties that are now on the theme must be defaulted at the build level, in order to respect any contributing theme properties. Because of this, some tests had to be modified to look at properties after they are built. Also, since default behaviors are now tested in the FAB Theme test, some default tests in the FAB test no longer applied and were removed.

Our old behavior may generate confusions for a sample app like our added golden test: Skia will shrink the cull rect (and thus the filtered area) to the text. The new behavior will fill the BackdropFilter to its parent/ancestor clip. This is more in align with our clip behaviors (no clip by default).  If this breaks your app, wrap the BackdropFilter with a ClipRect.  [wip] The golden images are not uploaded yet. I'll wait for the initial round of review to approve the golden test before uploading them.  * Statically define the callback  * Add TODO to remind the hacking code removal  * Nit fix  * Update goldens|

([#28169](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/28169))  In anticipation of changing a lot of the focus code, I'm adding some tests for the FocusScope.  As a result, I was able to find and fix a bug where there was an incorrect assert.  I also added some more documentation.  Several of the tests enforce what I think is incorrect behavior related to passing focus off when the widget tree gets rebuilt without focus nodes that were previously there, but I'm not going to change that behavior in this PR.  I also renamed focus_test.dart to focus_scope_test.dart to be more in line with our naming conventions.|

On the platform side, the touch event hits the FlutterTouchInterceptingView which is waiting for a framework decision that never arrived on whether to reject or accept the gesture.  This change fixes the issue by having RenderUiKitView register a global PointerRoute, that is used to reject absorbed touch events.|

([#28527](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/28527))  When we package Flutter, we used to find the "current" tag (which is the version number) by starting at the revision we are building on and looking backwards in time to find the most recent tag. This causes problems on release builds when we failed to tag properly.  This PR makes the packaging script be more strict by requiring the given revision to itself have a tag, but only when we're publishing the result. When we're not publishing the result, it's more lenient, since otherwise we couldn't test packaging on non-release commits.  I also renamed ProcessRunnerException to PreparePackageException, since we were using that exception more generally than just for processes.|

Unfortunately, this is probably not captured in our current benchmarks (presumably some other bottlenecks overshadow this shader compilation in the worst_frame benchmark). Considering that drawing images is such a common operation, maybe we should add one in the future to benchmark this.  We need this PR to land soon for our client because this changes the API to return Future.  ## Related Issues  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/813|

|liyuqian <liyuqian@google.com>|Add convex path and non-AA paint to shader warm-up ([#28614](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/28614))  One of our important client's SKP shows that this could improve one of their janky frame by 20ms. This also improves our flutter_gallery__transition_perf's worst frame time by ~20ms.  On the other hand, 15ms has been added to the start-up latency. I guess it's a little faster to compile the shader on the start-up because we're compiling a lot of shaders there and the CPU cache must be hot.  ## Related Issues  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/813|

Reason: start_up tests become flaky.  See https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/28374  TBR: xster  Merge on red to fix the tree|
|liyuqian <liyuqian@google.com>|Shader warm up ([#27660](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27660))  This patch adds a default shader warm up process which moves shader compilation from the animation time to the startup time. This also provides an extension for `runApp` so developers can customize the warm up process.  This should reduce our worst_frame_rasterizer_time_millis from ~100ms to ~20-30ms for both flutter_gallery and complex_layout benchmarks. Besides, this should also have a significant improvement on 90th and 99th percentile time (50%-100% speedup in some cases, but I haven't tested them thoroughly; I'll let our device lab collect the data afterwards).  The tradeoff the is the startup time (time to first frame). Our `flutter run --profile --trace-startup` seems to be a little noisy and I see about 100ms-200ms increase in that measurement for complex_layout and flutter_gallery. Note that this only happens on the first run after install or data wipe. Later the Skia persistent cache will remove the overhead.  This also adds a cubic_bezier benchmark to test the custom shader warm up process.  This should fix https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/813 (either by `defaultShaderWarmUp`, or a `customShaderWarmUp`).|

|Greg Spencer <gspencergoog@users.noreply.github.com>|Remove remaining "## Sample code" segments, and fix the snippet generator. ([#27793](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27793))  This converts all remaining "## Sample code" segments into snippets, and fixes the snippet generator to handle multiple snippets in the same dartdoc block properly.  I also generated, compiled, and ran each of the existing application samples, and fixed them up to be more useful and/or just run without errors.  This PR fixes these problems with examples:  1. Switching tabs in a snippet now works if there is more than one snippet in a single dartdoc block. 2. Generation of snippet code now works if there is more than one snippet. 3. Contrast of text and links in the code sample block has been improved to recommended levels. 4. Added five new snippet templates, including a "freeform" template to make it possible to show examples that need to change the app instantiation. 5. Fixed several examples to run properly, a couple by adding the "Scaffold" widget to the template, a couple by just fixing their code. 6. Fixed visual look of some of the samples when they run by placing many samples inside of a Scaffold. 7. In order to make it easier to run locally, changed the sample analyzer to remove the contents of the supplied temp directory before running, since having files that hang around is problematic (only a problem when running locally with the `--temp` argument). 8. Added a `SampleCheckerException` class, and handle sample checking exceptions more gracefully. 9. Deprecated the old "## Sample code" designation, and added enforcement for the deprecation. 10. Removed unnecessary `new` from templates (although they never appeared in the samples thanks to dartfmt, but still).  Fixes [#26398](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/26398) Fixes [#27411](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27411)|

|liyuqian <liyuqian@google.com>|Generate layer unique id for raster cache key ([#8637](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8637))  The raw pointer isn't a reliable id as the allocator can reuse an address that's just been released for another layer.  This will fix Fuchsia bug FL-216.  This problem was not affecting non-Fuchsia Flutter probably because non-Fuchsia Flutter purges the raster cache key much more frequently so we won't see a key collision. In Fuchsia, as the key has to wait for the Vulkan surface to render asynchronously, this suddenly becomes an issue.|

|Chinmay Garde <chinmaygarde@gmail.com>|Merge runtime lifecycle unittests into the base test target. ([#8634](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8634))  `//flutter/runtime: runtime_lifecycle_unittests` was added because the these assumed that there was no VM already running in the process. Running other tests in the base target would mess up that assumption. Now that all test targets have been updated to make sure the VM instance does not leak, the tests in this target can be merged.  LUCI bots don’t need to be patched as these tests were only ever run on the trybots.|

|Jason Simmons <jason-simmons@users.noreply.github.com>|Add an adjustment to the line width check in LineBreaker::addWordBreak ([#8623](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8623))  currentLineWidth is the width passed into Paragraph layout, which comes from the maxIntrinsicWidth returned by a previous call to Paragraph layout. That width is calculated by Layout::measureText.  postBreak is calculated from the character widths in the LineBreaker.  A slight mismatch between these two widths may unnecessarily cause the insertion of desperate breaks in addWordBreak.  Adding some slack to currentLineWidth works around this.

On its own this patch shouldn't result in any changes in behavior. This will need to be followed up with a patch in Fuchsia's Flutter runner to set the Z bounds after this lands, and another patch in the engine actually implementing the desired overflow behavior.  This Z bound info is routed through the engine itself to make sure the bounds in flow are truly consistent from the Fuchsia runner. However these values should eventually be exposed to the framework as well.|

Do the same thing for |FlutterEventTracer|, in order to unlock category "skia" trace events when running on Fuchsia.  The reason this was not working before is because |FlutterEventTracer| was directly using |fml::tracing::*| functions, rather than the TRACE_EVENT_* macros.  In the future, we can look into having the skia event tracer enabled by default on Fuchsia, controlling the presence of Skia events by enabling/disabling the "skia" category, once we measure the performance cost of doing so.|

|Chris Yang <ychris@google.com>|Delay platform view removal to submitFrame. ([#8380](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8380))  Remove platform views inside OnDispose might cause issue if it happens before SubmitFrame and the active_composition_order has not been updated. We will be left at a situation where the active_composition_order still contains the old view, but the view is actually removed from the UIView hierarchy.  We now cache the views need to be removed in OnDispose and actually remove them in SubmitFrame. At the same time, we remove stop detaching the subviews if they were disposed.  As a side effect, this update will also fix [flutter/flutter#30220](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/30220)|

|Michael Klimushyn <mklim@google.com>|Reduce z-fighting on Scenic ([#8318](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8318))  Previously the engine was creating multiple `ShapeNode`s all underneath the same root `EntityNode` at local space z=0. This caused frequent z-fighting within Flutter layers.  This patch updates the engine to only create one ShapeNode per EntityNode, which fixes the z-fighting independent of layer elevation. Z-fighting is still possible from actually setting multiple layers to the same z in world space using Flutter elevation.  [flutter/flutter#25226](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/25226)|

|Chinmay Garde <chinmaygarde@gmail.com>|Allow embedders to specify their own task runner interfaces. ([#8273](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8273))  Currently, all Flutter threads are managed by the engine itself. This works for all threads except the platform thread. On this thread, the engine cannot see the underlying event multiplexing mechanism. Using the new task runner interfaces, the engine can relinquish the task of setting up the event multiplexing mechanism and instead have the embedder provide one for it during setup.  This scheme is only wired up for the platform thread. But, the eventual goal is to expose this message loop interoperability for all threads.|

|Chinmay Garde <chinmaygarde@gmail.com>|Allow specification of std::functions as native entrypoints from Dart code. ([#8309](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8309))  This allows for the specification of std::functions (using EmbedderContext::NativeEntry) with their captures as native entrypoints. Earlier, only C functions we allowed which meant that there were no captures and assertions had to use globals which could introduce bugs when used with gtest_repeat.|

|Chinmay Garde <chinmaygarde@gmail.com>|Make it easy to write embedder unit tests by creating a fixture and config builder. ([#8276](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8276))  All embedder unit-tests have to setup the Flutter project arguments from scratch before launching the engine. The boilerplate and having to deal with the low level C API during each engine launch is a hinderance to writing tests.  This patch introduces an EmbedderTest fixture that sets up all the embedder side snapshots before allowing the unit test to create a FlutterConfigBuilder` that the test can use to incrementally build and edit the Flutter project configuration. From the given state state of a configuration, multiple engines can be launched with their lifecylces managed by appropriate RAII wrappers.  This allows the a fully configured Flutter engine to be launched using 4 lines of code in a fixture.  ``` EmbedderConfigBuilder builder; builder.SetSoftwareRendererConfig(); builder.SetAssetsPathFromFixture(this); builder.SetSnapshotsFromFixture(this); auto engine = builder.LaunchEngine(); ```|

Only works on Android versions earlier than Android P as it relies on reflection access to hidden system APIs which cannot be done starting Android P.  A11y is not yet working as we also need to delegate a11y events from the platform view to the FlutterView. This will be done in a following PR to keep the change size a little saner.|

|Kaushik Iska <iska.kaushik@gmail.com>|[ios] Set contentsScale before we commit CATransaction ([#8218](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8218))  Layout occurs after [CATransaction commit]. layoutSubviews was where we set the contentsScale on the CALayer. This meant that for one frame, we would see content on the overlay view which was did not have the correct content scale.  This change makes it so that we initialize the FlutterOverlayView with the correct contentsScale.  This also updates the overlay_gr_context_ when we first create the overlay_view. This is an artifact of [#8175](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8175).  This manifests as jank as seen in: [flutter/flutter#29573](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/29573)|

|Chris Yang <cyang8954@gmail.com>|[platform_view] iOSP platformView composition optimize. ([#8202](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8202))  Optimize the performance of the platform view composition. When recomposition is required, we previously remove all the platform view related views (intercepting view, platform view) and re-add them for each frame. This is mentioned in [flutter/flutter#23793](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/23793). This PR enhanced the performance by re-arrange the existing UIViews and only add the newly created Views.  As a result, it would also fix [flutter/flutter#29427](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/29427)|

|Amir Hardon <amirh@users.noreply.github.com>|Merge only gpu and platform threads for platform views, fix deadlock. ([#8045](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8045))  The reason we didn't merge just the gpu and platform threads from the get go was a deadlock in Shell:OnPlatformViewCreated and Shell:OnPlatformViewDestroyed.  The deadlock was caused by the platform thread starting a thread-hopping flow that ends ends up with the gpu thread releasing a latch that the platform thread is waiting on just after starting the cross-thread dance. If the platform and gpu threads are the same, that last task that is posted to the gpu thread will never get executed as the gpu/platform thread is blocked on a latch.  This works around the deadlock by having a special case in the code for the scenario where the gpu and platform threads are the same.  Fixes: [flutter/flutter#23974](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/23974)|

This is useful for writing custom ShaderWarmUp to reduce jank. By default, it's not enabled to reduce the overhead. This is only available in profile or debug build.  Later, we can add service protocol support to pull the skp from the client to the host. Currently, it works fine for Android-based devices (including our urgent internal clients) where we can `adb shell` into the cache directory.|

|Chinmay Garde <chinmaygarde@gmail.com>|Ensure that typed data is released within SendPlatformMessage scope. ([#8155](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8155))  We used to make tonic make the wrapper before the SendPlatformMessage invocation. However, tonic would not collect the wrapper before make the Dart API call to return the value from the native method. This is illegal and would trip an assertion in the Dart VM. A more systematic fix required reworking tonic to handle this case. However, to fix our illegal use of the Dart API now, this patch creates the wrapper manually in function scope.

|Jason Simmons <jason-simmons@users.noreply.github.com>|Look up ICU symbols based on the path to libflutter.so as a fallback ([#8139](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8139))  The ICU data is packaged within libflutter.so, and the engine uses dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT) to look up the ICU data symbols in the libraries loaded by the process.  This approach apparently fails on some Xiaomi devices.  If RTLD_DEFAULT can not find the symbols, then the platform will pass the path to the libflutter.so library so the engine can use that to resolve the symbols.

However, some embedders have that information upfront. Since the time point has already been specified by the embedder, there is no reason to burden the embedder with having to setup a wait either.|

|Chris Yang <cyang8954@gmail.com>|[platform_views] Fix duplicated touch event pass down to flutter view from platform view.  ([#8026](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/8026))  Fix for [flutter/flutter#27700](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/27700) and [flutter/flutter#24207](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/24207)  There are 2 fixes included in this PR.  The intercepting views sometime pass up the touches events to flutter view, even after the forward gesture recognizer pass the event to the flutter view. We only want the event to be passed to the flutter view once. So we let the intercepting view 'consumes' the event in this PR to fix the problem.  When a touch sequence has multiple touch points participated(e.g. Pinch gesture), the touchesBegan and touchesEnded can be triggered multiple times if the touches do not happen simultaneously. One example would be: when performing a pinch gesture with 2 fingers, I put down one finger, keep the finger on the screen, then put down another finger, perform pinch, lift up both finger at the same time. In this sequence, touchesBegan is called twice with each touch in one of the calls and touchesEnded is called once and has 2 touches in the callback. To handle this issue, we added a count to count the touches in one touch sequence. We only set the state to fail when the count reaches 0(That is all the touches has began in the current sequence is ended).|

|Chris Bracken <chris@bracken.jp>|Provide batching for semantics updates ([#7988](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/7988))  Some embedders prefer to minimise the number of semantics node/custom action updates sent back to the host platform -- for example due to expensive serialisation mechanisms, etc.  This patch provides a 'batch end' signal that provides embedders with an indication of when a self-consistent set of semantics node or custom action updates have been sent.  We overload the node/action ID with information that conveys a batch end by using an ID (-1) that is never allotted to semantics nodes by the framework.|

|Chris Bracken <chris@bracken.jp>|Add accessibility semantics support to embedder ([#7891](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/7891))  Flutter's accessibility APIs consist of three main calls from the embedder to the Dart application:  1. FlutterEngineUpdateSemanticsEnabled: enables/disables semantics support.  2. FlutterEngineUpdateAccessibilityFeatures: sets embedder-specific accessibility features.  3. FlutterEngineDispatchSemanticsAction: dispatches an action (tap, long-press, scroll, etc.) to a semantics node.  and two main callbacks triggered by Dart code:  1. FlutterUpdateSemanticsNodeCallback: notifies the embedder of updates to the properties of a given semantics node.  2. FlutterUpdateSemanticsCustomActionCallback: notifies the embedder of updates to custom semantics actions registered in Dart code.  In the Flutter framework, when accessibility is first enabled, the embedder will receive a stream of update callbacks notifying the embedder of the full semantics tree. On further changes in the Dart application, only updates will be sent.|

|Chinmay Garde <chinmaygarde@gmail.com>|Shut down and restart the Dart VM as needed. ([#7832](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/7832))  The shell was already designed to cleanly shut down the VM but it couldnt earlier as |Dart_Initialize| could never be called after a |Dart_Cleanup|. This meant that shutting down an engine instance could not shut down the VM to save memory because newly created engines in the process after that point couldn't restart the VM. There can only be one VM running in a process at a time.  This patch separate the previous DartVM object into one that references a running instance of the DartVM and a set of immutable dependencies that components can reference even as the VM is shutting down.  Unit tests have been added to assert that non-overlapping engine launches use difference VM instances.|

|Ben Konyi <bkonyi@google.com>|Add support for calling into other plugins from a background context on iOS ([#7843](https://github.com/flutter/engine/issues/7843))  Added `FlutterPluginRegistrantCallback` typedef and optional `setPluginRegistrantCallback` static method in `FlutterPlugin`. `setPluginRegistrantCallback` is used to set a callback defined in AppDelegate.m which registers some subset of plugins with a `FlutterPluginRegistry` (for example, a headless FlutterEngine). This allows for plugins which utilize background execution functionality to enable the use of other plugins on the background isolate. This puts iOS on par with Android for background execution.  Along with updated examples and Medium posts, this fixes [[flutter/flutter#21925](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/21925)](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/21925).|

|Michael Klimushyn <mklim@google.com>|[in_app_purchase] Minor bugfixes and code cleanup ([#1284](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/issues/1284))  Some refactoring split out from a future patch on querying the purchase history.  1. Moved all Android app-specific information to the keystore.properties file. I initially didn't put everything there because normally the keystore file only has signing information. But the app ID, verison name, and version code all do need to be potentially modified in the example to get it up and running. They're not inherently sensitive like the signing information is but it probably makes sense to keep them out of source control for the plugin repo too. 2. Fixed the MethodChannel argument naming for some of the new methods. 3. Added a missing `BillingResponse` code. 4. Changed the `BillingClient#_callbacks` to be a map of lists instead of a list of maps. The OnPurchasesUpdated() listener is a singleton and we never really have a good opportunity to pass down a `handle`. It makes more sense to me to store these by name. Also deleted the `remove` code since it would cause `handle` to be off for future entries. 5. Fixed a concurrency issue on Android in the example app, and tweaked the UI slightly.|

Also exposes BillingClient#queryPurchaseHistoryAsync, which returns the most recent purchase of the user for each SKU of the given type.

Since FIAPRequestHandler is the delegate, when SKProductRequest tries to execute the delegate method, it will not be able to find the delegate. Hence the crash.  Adding a set to hold strong reference of the FIAPRequestHandler until it is complete fix the crash.|
