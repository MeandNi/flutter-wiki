A loose collection of notes about null safety in Flutter.

## Flutter beta build

Flutter supports null safety in the [beta channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels).
starting with build `1.24.0-10.2.pre`.

You can change to the beta channel with `flutter channel beta` followed by `flutter upgrade`.

## Enabling null safety

To enable null safety in a new package or app, see [the null safety introduction](https://dart.dev/null-safety).

## Migrating packages to null safety

See the [null safety migration guide](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide).

## More information

A good example of this is the [Flutter null safety sample](https://github.com/flutter/samples/tree/master/experimental/null_safety).
