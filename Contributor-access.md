For people who make the occasional contribution to Flutter (filing an issue, submitting the occasional PR), the default set of permissions is fine. However, if you are a frequent contributor, whether helping us in triage, or often fixing bugs, or regularly improving our documentation, you may find your life is more pleasant with commit access (also know as "contributor access", "being a member of the flutter-hackers group", "being a member of the Flutter team").

We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained our trust and demonstrated a commitment to Flutter.

Specifically, if you meet one of the following criteria and you have a sponsor (someone who already has contributor access and agrees that you should be granted access), then please contact @Hixie and ask if you can be granted access. The possible criteria are:

* You have submitted several PRs that have landed successfully (received an LGTM, PR was merged, no regressions reported, PR was not reverted).
* You have a history of participating in our chat channels, helping with [[Triage]], helping other contributors track down problems, finding meaningful issues in submitted PRs.
* You are employed by a company with a history of contributing to Flutter, for the purpose of yourself regularly contributing to Flutter.
* You represent a development team that creates applications, plugins, or packages using Flutter and have a close relationship with our developer relations team, including having a customer label (see [Issue hygiene, Customers](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Issue-hygiene#customers)).

Being granted access means that you will be added to the "flutter-hackers" group on GitHub. This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: contributors are people who care about Flutter and want to help Flutter along our [[roadmap]]. A contributor is not just someone who can make changes or comment on issues, but someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most knowledgeable people to review code, contribute high-quality code, follow through to fix bugs (in code or tests), and provide meaningful insights on issues.

We grant access optimistically based on a reasonably small volume of evidence of good faith. Correspondingly, we will remove access quickly if we find our trust has been violated. Contributors with commit access must still follow all our processes and policies, and must follow our [code of conduct](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) rigorously. (Please read it, it's stricter than most.)

## Process

The actual process (as followed by GitHub admins) is as follows:

1. Verify the identity of the person making the request.
2. Click the "Add a member" button on [the flutter-hackers team page](https://github.com/orgs/flutter/teams/flutter-hackers/members) on GitHub.
