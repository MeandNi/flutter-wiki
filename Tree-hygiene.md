## tl;dr

Submit PRs. You must add tests. Tests must pass. A team member must say LGTM. Watch the dashboards for regressions.
Revert and ask questions later if a test fails or performance regresses on master.
A breaking change is one that breaks the tests in the flutter/tests repo, those need a migration guide.


## Introduction

This page covers how to land a PR and other aspects of writing code for
Flutter other than the actual writing of the code. For guidance on
designing APIs, documenting, and formatting your code, see the
[[Style guide for Flutter repo]] document.

## Overview

The general process for submitting code to a Flutter repository is as follows:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub (see the
   [contributing guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
   for advice on doing this and in general setting up your development environment).

2. If there is not already an issue covering the work you are interested in doing,
   and if you think the work you are doing is likely to be a non-trivial effort
   (e.g. you are creating a new widget, or otherwise introducing a new API surface,
   or intending to make a potentially breaking change, or refactoring a library),
   then file a new bug to describe the issue you are addressing.

3. If the work you are doing is likely to be a non-trivial effort (see above), then
   discuss your design on the issue. You may find it useful to create a Google Doc to
   solicit feedback (use the template at [flutter.dev/go/template](https://flutter.dev/go/template)).
   You may wish to e-mail the mailing list, or discuss the topic
   on our [[Chat]] channels. The more buy-in you get from the rest of the
   team (especially the relevant leads), the easier the rest of the process will be.
   You can put the label "proposal" on your issue to indicate that you have a design
   up for discussion in the issue.

4.  If the work you are doing affects our privacy surface, such as modifying how 
    we collect analytics, crash logs, or the like, then please reach out to a Googler
    to discuss your changes (you'll want to start a Google Doc to
    solicit feedback (use the template at [flutter.dev/go/template](https://flutter.dev/go/template)),
    who will be happy to loop in one of our engineers who explicitly focus on privacy issues
    so that they're able to give feedback on the work you plan to do.

5. Create a branch off master on your GitHub fork of the repository, and implement
   your change. Make sure it is tested. Consider using the code coverage tools to check
   that all your new code is covered by tests (see [[Test coverage for package:flutter]]).

   Everything must be tested. If you think your PR should be exempt from requiring
   tests, please contact Hixie for an exemption.

   You must follow the guidelines described in the [[Style guide for Flutter repo]].
   Files must not have trailing spaces and the analyzer must not report anything.
   (See [[Using the Dart analyzer]]).
   For the engine repository, C, C++, and Objective-C code should be formatted with
   `clang-format` before submission (use `buildtools/<OS>/clang/bin/clang-format
   --style=file -i`).

6. Submit this branch as a PR to the relevant Flutter repository.

7. Get your code reviewed (see below). You should probably reach out to the relevant
   expert(s) for the areas you touched and ask them to review your PR directly.
   GitHub sometimes recommends specific reviewers; if you're not sure who to ask,
   that's probably a good place to start.

8. Make sure your PR passes all the pre-commit tests. Consider running some of the
   post-commit tests locally (see the
   [devicelab](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/dev/devicelab/README.md)
   directory). If any tests break, especially the `customer_testing` tests, please
   see the breaking change policy section below for details on how to proceed.

   Wait for Cirrus to give the green light before merging a PR. Cirrus
   runs a bunch of pre-commit checks (e.g. see the tests for the
   [framework](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/dev/bots/test.dart),
   or the [engine](https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/ci/build.sh)).
   These checks include checks on comments, so make sure you wait for the
   green light even if your patch is _obviously_ fine!

   The `flutter-build` test isn't checking your PR, it's letting you know
   whether the tree itself is passing the tests right now (including post-
   commit tests). If it is red, help out the team in fixing the tree before
   continuing. It is everyone's job to keep the tree green.

   **If the trees or dashboards are showing any regressions, only fixes
   that improve the situation are allowed to go in.**

9. Once everything is green and you have an LGTM, land your patch.

10. Watch the post-commit tests on the dashboard to make sure everything passes. If anything
   goes wrong, revert your patch and study the problem. You should aim to be the one to
   revert your patch. You will be racing everyone else on the team who will also be trying
   to revert your patch.

11. Changes that break the [flutter/plugins CI](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/flutter/plugins/master) should as well be reverted while the problem is being studied.

## Using git

Assuming your environment has been configured according to the instructions in
[[Setting up the Engine development environment]] or
[[Setting up the Framework development environment]],
follow these steps to start working on a patch:

 * `git fetch upstream`
 * `git checkout upstream/master -b name_of_your_branch`
 * `flutter update-packages`
 * Hack away.
 * `git commit -a -m "<your informative commit message>"`
 * `git push origin name_of_your_branch`

GitHub provides you with a link for submitting the pull request in the message output by `git push`.

Note that `git pull` will often miss tags that are used to define the release of the flutter tool so it is recommended to use `git fetch` typically to avoid version mismatches when running `flutter update-packages`.

Please make sure all your patches have detailed commit messages explaining what the problem was and
what the solution is.

You must complete the
[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).
You can do this online, and it only takes a minute.
If you've never submitted code before, you must add your (or your
organization's) name and contact info to the [AUTHORS](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/AUTHORS) file.


## Getting a code review

Every PR must be code-reviewed before check-in, including things like
rolling a dependency. Getting a review means that a regular Flutter
contributor (someone with commit access) has written a comment saying
"LGTM" on your PR, and you have addressed all their feedback. ("LGTM"
means "Looks Good To Me".)

If nobody reviews your PR within a few days, you can ask for a review
via our [[Chat]] channels (start by asking in #hackers, saying what your
patch does and providing a link).

Code review serves many critical purposes. There's the obvious
purpose: catching errors. Even the most experienced engineers
frequently make errors that are caught by code review. But there are
also many other benefits of code reviews:

 * It spreads knowledge among the team. Since every line of code will
   have been read by two people, it's more likely that once you move
   on, someone else will understand the code.

 * It keeps you honest. Knowing that someone will be reading your
   code, you are less tempted to cut corners and more motivated to
   write code you are proud of.

 * It exposes you to different modes of thinking. Your code reviewer
   has probably not thought about the problem in the same way you
   have, and so may have a fresh perspective and may find you a better
   way to solve the problem.

We recommend you consider
[these suggestions](https://testing.googleblog.com/2017/06/code-health-too-many-comments-on-your.html)
for addressing code review comments on your PR.

If you're working on a big patch, don't hesitate to get reviews early,
before you're ready to check code in. Also, don't hesitate to ask for
multiple people to review your code, and don't hesitate to provide unsolicited
comments on other people's PRs. The more reviews the better.

A reviewer may in some circumstances consider the code satisfactory
without having fully reviewed or understood it. If a reviewer has not
fully reviewed the code, they admit to this by saying "RSLGTM" rather
than just "LGTM". If you feel your code needs a real review, please
find someone to actually review it. ("RSLGTM" means "Rubber Stamp
Looks Good To Me".)


## How to review code

Reviewers should carefully read the code and make sure they understand
it. A reviewer should check the code for both high level concerns,
such as whether the approach is reasonable and whether the code's structure makes sense, as well as
lower-level issues like how readable the code is and adherence to the
[Flutter style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo).
Use [these best practices](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/)
when reviewing code and providing comments.

As a reviewer, you are the last line of defense. 

1. Take a step back. What problem is the PR trying to solve? Is it a real problem?
2. What other solutions could we consider? What could we do to make this even better?
3. Is it the best API? See our [philosophy](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#philosophy) section. Look for state duplication, synchronous slow work, complecting, global state,
overly-specific APIs, API cliffs and API oceans, API design in a vacuum (without a customer). If these terms
don't make sense, read the style guide again. :-)
4. Is it the best implementation? Again, see our [style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#coding-patterns-and-catching-bugs-early), in particular its section on good coding patterns. Are there hacks? Are we taking on more technical debt? Think of ways in which the code could break.
5. Is it testable? Is it tested? **All code must be tested.** Are there asserts? Encourage liberal use of assertions.
6. Look for mistakes in indenting the code and other trivial formatting problems.
7. Is new code licensed correctly?
8. Is the documentation thorough and useful? Look for useless documentation, empty prose, and breadcrumbs. See the [documentation section](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo#documentation-dartdocs-javadocs-etc) of our style guide for what that means.
9. Check for good grammar in API docs and comments. Check that identifiers are named according to our conventions.

Once you are satisfied with the contribution, and _only_ once you are satisfied,
write a comment that includes the phrase LGTM (or use the GitHub "Approval" mechanism).
If you feel like you are being worn down, hand the review to someone else. Consider
our [conflict resolution](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#conflict-resolution)
policy if you feel like you are being forced to agree to something you don't like.

Reviewers should not give an LGTM unless the patch has tests that verify
all the affected code, or unless a test would make no sense. If you
review a patch, you are sharing the responsibility for the patch with
its author. You should only give an LGTM if you would feel confident
answering questions about the code.

In general, reviewers should favor approving a PR once it is in a state where it definitely improves the overall code health of the system being worked on, even if the PR isn't perfect.

Reviewers should always feel free to leave comments expressing that something could be better, but if it's not very important, prefix it with something like "Shouldn't block this PR but: " to let the author know that it's just a point of polish that they could choose to ignore in the current PR (these should be documented in TODO comments with a tracking issue).

If you are 100% sure the patch is good and has no issues but you haven't
really fully reviewed or understood it, you can give it a rubber-stamp
review by marking it RSLGTM. If you mark a patch as RSLGTM, you are still
sharing the responsibility for the patch with its author. Reviewing a
patch as RSLGTM should be a rare event.

If you are not a regular Flutter contributor (someone with commit access),
we very much welcome your reviews on code contributions in the form of comments
on the code, but please refrain from approving or LGTM'ing changes, as it
confuses PR authors, who may think your approval is authoritative and merge
the PR prematurely.


## Landing a patch

Once you have submitted your patch and received your LGTM, if you do not have commit access to
the repository yet, then wait for one of the project maintainers to submit it for you.

If you do have access, you can just click the green "Merge pull request" button on the GitHub UI
of your pull request. Please squash commits (GitHub does this for you by default normally).

### Squashing commits

When you squash commits, by default, GitHub will concatenate all your commit messages to form a unified commit message.  This often yields an overly verbose commit message with many unhelpful entries (e.g. "fix typo").  Please double-check (and hand-edit if necessary) your commit message before merging such that the message contains a helpful description of the overall change.

## Landing a patch in a hurry (for emergencies)

If you really need to check something in in a hurry, for example
because everything is broken and you can fix it, then pick someone on
the team who you want to have review the code, and then mark the PR as
"TBR" with their name. ("TBR" means "To Be Reviewed".) This is only to
be used in emergencies. (Nobody being around to review your 50,000
line patch at midnight on December 31st is not an emergency!) If
someone marks a patch as TBR and gives your name as the reviewer, you
should review the patch as soon as possible. If a reviewer finds
problems with a patch marked TBR, the issues should be fixed as soon
as possible.

In general, if you are reverting the very last commit, you can land
the commit without waiting for the bots to complete, since by definition
you are bringing the tree back to a known configuration.

If you're either adding new code or reverting a commit that isn't the last
commit, then you are still bringing the tree to a new state, so please
still wait for all the pre-commit tests to go green even if you are unable
to find someone to review the patch before you land. (But then, if you
aren't able to find anyone to review your patch, is it really an emergency?)


## Regressions in functionality

If a check-in has caused a regression on master for any of the flutter repositories, revert (roll back) the
check-in (even if it isn't yours). When master is broken, it slows down
everyone else on the project, so we want to get the tree green again as soon
as possible.

If you revert is a straight revert, then you do not need to wait for precommit
tests before landing it. Just create the revert and land it, then tell the person
whose patch you reverted, that you reverted their patch (also leave a comment
on the PR that you reverted).

If things are broken, the priority of everyone on the team should be
helping the team fix the problem. Someone (you, if nobody else has yet
taken ownership) should own the issue, and they can delegate responsibilities
to others on the team. Once the problem is resolved, write a
[post-mortem](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Postmortems).
Postmortems are about documenting what went wrong and how to avoid the
problem (and the entire class of problems like it) from recurring in
the future. Postmortems are emphatically _not_ about assigning blame.

There is no shame in making mistakes.

If the regression still left the tree in a green state (meaning that
the failure is one we were not previously testing for), please update
the [[Bad Builds]] page to note which builds were affected, so that we
don't release a beta build with the regression. Then, write a test for
this failure mode! See [[Running and writing tests]] for more details.


## Regressions in performance

After each check-in, please monitor the [performance dashboard](https://flutter-dashboard.appspot.com/benchmarks.html).

If you see a regression (any of the charts increasing after your commit), please
follow these steps:

* Comment on the PR acknowledging the regression.
* If the regression is expected and is a desirable trade-off (e.g. disk size
increased slightly in exchange for a significant improvement in speed), then
rebaseline the relevant benchmarks (log in, then click the magnifying glass
at the top right of each chart, then click the button to auto rebaseline and
commit).
* If the regression is not expected, and may be a problem in your PR, revert
your PR and investigate.
* If the regression is not expected, and is quite severe, revert your PR and
investigate.
* If the regression is not expected, and is not severe, and is definitely not
a problem in your PR (e.g. you changed a comment and the analyzer performance
got worse, or you deleted a README and the rasterizer slowed down), then file
a bug, labeled with the "regression", "performance", `P0` labels, and either
investigate or delegate to someone to investigate. The investigation should be
considered a high priority. It is your responsibility to make sure that the
cause is understood within a few days.

Performance regressions are not a problem so long as they are promptly dealt with.
Therefore, Flutter considers all unexpected performance regressions to be TODAY,
or the highest-priority issues until we have it under control
(e.g. we know what caused it and either have a fix under way or have determined
it is an acceptable trade-off).

### Performance regressions caused by auto-roller commits

Although reverting a normal commit that caused performance regressions is the default
behavior, reverting an [auto-roller](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Autorollers)
(e.g., an engine-roller commit like https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/fdcb57b69eff2162e9aead6dec0f8058788e7608)
commit could cause some complications:

1. The auto-roller commit usually include multiple commits of the source repo (e.g., engine-roller
commit includes multiple commits of https://github.com/flutter/engine). This can be applied
recursively as the engine-roller commit includes a dart-roller commit, or a skia-roller commit.
Therefore, a roller commit could actually include a ton of leaf-level commits, which makes it
really hard to triage which leaf commit actually caused the regression.

2. The auto-roller will try to roll again as soon as possible that will reland any changes reverted
by a Flutter commit revert. So in order to keep the revert effective, one has to either
(1) pause the auto-roller, or (2) revert the leaf commit in the source repo.

3. If the auto-roller is paused for a long time (say 1 day), the source repo will accumulate many
commits. That makes the next roll very hard to manage: it's difficult to triage a build failure
or a new performance regression caused by the next roll, since that roll will include all the commits
in the paused period.

Therefore, reverting a roller commit or pausing the auto-roller is 
*NOT* the default action if it causes a performance regression.
The default action should be to file an issue with labels "performance", "regression", and `P0`
immediately, and start investigating which leaf-commit caused the regression. Once the leaf-commit
is identified, check if it's an expected trade-off. If so, remove the `P0` label and try to see
if there's any way to mitigate the regression. If not, revert the leaf commit in the source repo
and let the auto-roller apply that revert. Once the revert is rolled into Flutter, close the issue.


## Avoid "Revert "Revert "Revert "Revert "Fix foo"""" commit messages

Please limit yourself to one "Revert" per commit message, otherwise we won't
have any idea what is actually landing. Is it putting us back to where we were before?
Is it adding new code? Is it a controversial new feature that actually caused
a regression before but is now fixed (we hope)?

Only use "Revert" if you are actually returning us to a known-good state.
When you later revert the revert, just land the PR afresh with the original commit message,
possibly updated with the information since collected (and ideally, including a link
to the original PR and to the revert PR so that people can follow the breadcrumbs later).


## Handling breaking changes

In general, we want to avoid making changes to Flutter, our plugins, or our packages, that force developers using Flutter to change their code in order to upgrade to new versions of Flutter. See [our compatibility policy](https://flutter.dev/docs/resources/compatibility).

Sometimes, however, doing this is necessary for the greater good. We want our APIs to be
intuitive; if being backwards-compatible requires making an API into something that we would
never have designed that way unless forced to by circumstances, then we should instead break
the API and make it good.

The process for making breaking changes is as follows:

### 1. Determine if your change is a breaking change

The first step in making a breaking change is to implement the change you wish to see and run the existing tests against your new code (without having changed the tests first). Changes that break (i.e. require changes to) one or more of the contributed tests are considered "breaking changes".

The "contributed tests" are:

* Those in the [`customer_testing`](https://github.com/flutter/tests) shard on `flutter/flutter` PRs.
* Additional test suites that we have been allowed to run but that are not public. (Notably, Google allows us to run several tens of thousands of proprietary tests on each commit.)

You can contribute tests to the flutter/tests repo by following [the instructions](https://github.com/flutter/tests/blob/master/README.md) on that repo. If you have a significant test suite that you would like to have be considered part of the breaking change definition (one too big to land in the flutter/tests repo), please contact Hixie at ian@hixie.ch.

In cases where we can imagine reasonable scenarios where developers would be affected negatively, by courtesy, once the change has landed, engineers are encouraged to announce the changes by sending an e-mail to flutter-announce and listing it on our [[Changelog]] wiki page (such that they will be included in our release notes). However, we do not consider these breaking changes. (One reason to do this would be if we see our own tests being significantly affected, even if no contributed test actually fails.)

This definitions is binding. If you think you need an exemption to this policy, please contact Hixie on the #hackers [[Chat]] channel. If a breaking change lands without following this policy and without an explicit exemption from @Hixie, it must be reverted.

### 2. Evaluate the breaking change proposal

If you discover that your change would be a breaking change as defined above, we must carefully evaluate it. Create a design document ([use this template](https://flutter.dev/go/template)). You want to describe the change in detail, and ask for feedback. Things you should include are:

* What problem are you solving?
* What does migrating code to your proposed new API look like? Show several before and after examples.
* What other alternatives did you consider?
* A request for feedback. Is the change valuable?

Link to your design document from your issue. Ping @RedBrogdon on the #hackers-devrel channel in [[Chat]] and point him to your design document. Bring it up in the #general channel as well. Send an e-mail to the flutter-dev@ mailing list asking for feedback on your design doc. Allow for several (two or three) days of discussion. 

Consider if you really need to make this change. In general, merely renaming a class to make things slightly clearer is insufficient value to justify a breaking change. Such changes leave behind a legacy of old tutorials, YouTube videos, StackOverflow comments, etc, that reference the old name, and so any improvement to the developer experience can be easily offset by the added burden on our ecosystem as a whole. (We record such changes we wish we could make on https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/24722, feel free to add it there.)


### 3. Prepare your change.

Rather than deploying the proposed change as one PR that immediately breaks existing code, adjust your PR so that it introduces the new functionality, API, behavior change, etc, in an opt-in fashion.

_For example, rather than replacing a widget with another, introduce the new widget and discourage use of the old one. Rather than changing the order in which a certain argument is processed, provide a flag that selects which order the arguments will be processed in._

When changing the semantics of an API with a temporary opt-in, a three-phase change is needed (adding the new API and opt-in, then removing the old API, then removing the opt-in.)

If possible, avoid four-phase deprecations (adding a new API with a temporary name and deprecating an old API, removing the old API, changing the new API to the old name and deprecating the temporary name, and finally removing the temporary name), because they involve a lot of churn and will irritate our developers.

Stage your change and the documentation for your change. Typically this will be two or more PRs, plus PRs to fix the tests that were broken (see step 1), as well as writing a migration guide as a PR to the Website repository.

Use our [breaking change migration guide template](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/master/src/docs/release/breaking-changes/template.md) (every part in square brackets should be changed) to create the migration guide that describes the change. Do not land the migration guide at this time. You will need to update it before you land it in the last step.

**You must ask @Hixie on Discord to review the migration guide before landing your PRs.** Until we have experience with writing these regularly, we need to make sure they're consistent in style. (Don't bother asking on GitHub, Hixie gets too many GitHub notifications to read them. See [[Chat]] for how to use our Discord server.)


### 4. Land your change.

Once you are ready, have received feedback, iterated on your design and your migration guide, land your initial change and start migrating clients. *Do not yet land the migration guide.* Once all the clients are migrated, land your final change. (You may have several iterations here if you have a multiphase roll-out.)

During this process, each individual PR does not break any tests, so it should not block any autorollers.


### 5. Document the change, including clear documentation for migrating code, with samples, and clear rationales for each change

Once everything has landed, update your migration guide based on your experience migrating everyone, update the timeline on the guide, and push it to [the flutter.dev Web site](https://flutter.dev/docs/release/breaking-changes) (don't forget to update the [index](https://github.com/flutter/website/blob/master/src/docs/release/breaking-changes/index.md) of that directory as well), e-mail a copy to flutter-announce, and update the [[Changelog]] wiki page.

When updating the [[Changelog]] and the timeline section of the migration guide, to figure out the correct version heading for the changelog run `git fetch upstream && flutter --version`. For example, if it says "Flutter 1.2.23-pre.10" in the output your changelog entry should be under heading "Changes since 1.2.22".


#### Deprecation

Old APIs can be marked as deprecated as part of this process. Deprecation is not a way to avoid making a breaking change; you should consider deprecating an API to be equivalent to removing it, as some of our customers (and we ourselves) consider using a deprecated API to be anathema (triggering a build failure).

The syntax for deprecations must match the following pattern:

```dart
@Deprecated(
  'Call prepareFrame followed by owner.requestVisualUpdate() instead. '
  'This feature was deprecated after v1.7.3.'
)
```

In other words:

```dart
@Deprecated(
  '[description of how to migrate] '
  'This feature was deprecated after [dev version at time of deprecation].'
)
```

Using this standard form ensures that we can write a script to detect all deprecated APIs and remove them. We have a test that verifies that this syntax is followed.

When deprecating features, be aware that you will not by default be informed when the Flutter code itself uses the deprecated feature. To find places where the old feature is used, rename its declaration and see where the compiler complains.

_This policy does not require that deprecated features be removed promptly, nor does it require that we limit the use of deprecations. While you are encouraged to please use moderation and judgement in deciding to deprecate something, there is no quota, and there is no time limit to how long a deprecated feature may remain supported before it is removed. We will, at a later time, introduce a policy for removing deprecated features, in a "first-in-first-out" fashion (this is why the syntax required here mentions a version number)._
