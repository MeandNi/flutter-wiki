Some teams using Flutter have a special relationship with the Flutter team, such as being an early-access partner. We provide such customers with a label in our GitHub issue tracker, and encourage them to mark bugs as "customer blocker" (for the most serious bugs) or "customer critical" (for still important but not quite as serious bugs) if they are very important and deserve immediate attention.

Each week, we ensure that bugs marked with these labels have someone assigned to them so that they are likely to get traction.

Be wary in marking bugs as "customer blocker". We have finite resources, and several customers. If you have one "blocker" bug, then we have a clear sign of what to look at. If you have twenty, it will be difficult for us to know where to start.
